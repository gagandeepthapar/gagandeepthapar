<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Gagan</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Aerospace Engineering (w/ minor in CS) graduate student at Cal Poly SLO who's extremely interested in spacecraft controls, specifically autonomous control, Entry/Descent/Landing, <a href="https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/pinpointRocketLanding" target="_blank">trajectory optimization</a>, and Markov Decision Processes. I'm hoping to take my skills to a doctoral program where I can research these problems closely and help get closer to more robust spacecraft GNC.</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **[my thesis](https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/StarTrackerThesis)** to develop a **[robust measurement process model for star trackers](https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/StarTrackerMPM)** in LEO by looking at effects on accuracy and precision due to hardware, software, and environmental conditions.

- 👨‍💻 While on the topic of Star Trackers, check out my work with the **[Cal Poly CubeSat Lab](https://www.polysat.org/)** to develop our own low-cost, low-volume star tracker! I wrote all of the code to **[generate ground truth data and simulated images](https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/StarTrackerImageGen)** and am currently working to write our own centroiding algorithms via Convolution Matrices and CNNs!
