<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Gagan</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Aerospace Engineering/Computer Science grad student at Cal Poly SLO who's extremely interested in stochastic optimal control, spacecraft entry/descent/landing (EDL), <a href="https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/pinpointRocketLanding" target="_blank">trajectory optimization</a>, and state estimation.</h3>

- 🚀 I'm currently working on a few side projects including a Python library for Orbital Mechanics, developing CPP/Python packages for various simulation components, and a large scale rocket-landing simulator complete from state estimation to state actuation to trajectory generation and navigation! Check back soon for updates!
  
- 🔭 I recently finished my thesis to develop a **[robust measurement process model for star trackers](https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/StarTrackerMPM)** in LEO by looking at effects on accuracy and precision due to hardware, software, and environmental conditions.

- 👨‍💻 While on the topic of Star Trackers, check out my work with the **[Cal Poly CubeSat Lab](https://www.polysat.org/)** to develop our own low-cost, low-volume star tracker! I wrote all of the code to **[generate ground truth data and simulated images](https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/StarTrackerImageGen)** and am currently working to write our own centroiding algorithms via Convolution Matrices and CNNs!

- 💬 Feel free to browse through my other **[side projects](https://github.com/gagandeepthapar?tab=repositories)**

- 📄 Interested in my professional background? See my CV [here](https://github.com/gagandeepthapar/gagandeepthapar/blob/main/ThaparGagandeepCV.pdf)

- ⚡ Fun fact: **I've fostered 5 cats (and adopted 2 of them) through my school's Cat Fostering Program**
